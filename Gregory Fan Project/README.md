Gregory Fan's Submission for UPE Project

I made a short game where you walk through an empty city, then through a forest, then a cliff. There IS a end to the walk if one wishes to.

The game is made in Unity Game Engine and coded in C#.
Sounds are NOT made by me, taken from freesound.org.
Art assets and code are made by me.

The file of the game is a copy of the original folder read by Unity.
Playable versions are in the Builds folder.
There might be resolution issues when starting the game.

Very mild content warning: implied suicide.
